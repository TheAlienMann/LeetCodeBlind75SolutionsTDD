# MergeTwoSortedLinkedList

This solution so far, should pass the tests, but i need to build a way to actually test it.
if i make the LinkedList conform to Equatable protocol, meanin first the produced linkedlist from the function and the expected one have to have the same length, then each node at the same index should be equal. the node class already confroms to the equatable protocol, so to make the LinkedList also conform to it, i think i just need to loop over both of them check if the node(at:index) es are equal or not ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
